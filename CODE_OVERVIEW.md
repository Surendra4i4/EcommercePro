## Data Flow

1. **Authentication Flow**
   - User enters credentials on the auth page
   - Frontend sends login/register request to the backend
   - Backend validates credentials and creates a session
   - Frontend stores user information in auth context
   - Protected routes check auth context before rendering

2. **Shopping Flow**
   - Products are fetched from the backend API
   - User adds products to the cart (managed in cart context)
   - Cart data is persisted in localStorage
   - User proceeds to checkout
   - Shipping information and payment method are collected
   - Order is submitted to the backend
   - User is redirected to the home page after successful order

3. **Indian Currency Implementation**
   - Product prices are stored in USD in the backend
   - Frontend uses currency conversion utilities to display prices in INR
   - Shopping cart and checkout components show INR prices with USD reference
   - Order totals are calculated in USD and converted to INR for display

## Key Features Implementation

### Indian Payment Methods

The checkout form includes options for Indian payment methods:
- PhonePe
- Google Pay
- Paytm

Each payment method has a custom SVG icon and is implemented as a radio button option in the payment step of the checkout process.

### Currency Conversion

The application uses a fixed exchange rate (1 USD = 75 INR) for currency conversion. The `currency.ts` file provides several utility functions:

- `usdToInr`: Converts USD amount to INR
- `formatInr`: Formats a number as an INR string with the â‚¹ symbol
- `formatUsd`: Formats a number as a USD string with the $ symbol
- `getInrFromUsd`: Returns both the converted amount and formatted string

These functions are used consistently throughout the application to ensure uniform price display.

## Component Structure

The application follows a modular component structure:

- **Layout Components**: Header, Footer, Layout wrapper
- **Page Components**: Home, Auth, Checkout, Admin
- **Feature Components**: ProductCard, ProductGrid, ShoppingCart, CheckoutForm
- **UI Components**: Button, Card, Input, etc. (using shadcn/ui)

## State Management

The application uses a combination of:

- **React Context API** for global state (auth, cart)
- **TanStack Query** for server state and data fetching
- **React Hook Form** for form state
- **localStorage** for persisting cart data between sessions
